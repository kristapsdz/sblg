	<p>
		Tag symbols appear in XML input files and templates and are filled in with information pertaining to the current relevant
		article.
		For example, the default navigation list can be customised by specifying re-use of internal contents and using tag symbols.
		This can be seen in the <a href="index.html#blog">blog-roll</a> and are described in <a href="article7.html">Tips and
			Tricks: Fancy Navigation</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tags are even more useful in combined mode described in <a href="sblg.1.html">sblg(1)</a>, which is how this file
		was created:
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		<code class="prettyprint lang-sh">% sblg -o article9.html -C article9.xml article1.xml ... article9.xml</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Note</strong>: using this invocation is the same reason why the permanent link below this page doesn't work properly!
		(This is described in <a href="sblg.1.html">sblg(1)</a>, and is a known caveat to be solved later.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Now if I use the &#36;{sblg-prev-base} to show the <a href="${sblg-prev-base}.html">previous article</a> when chronologically
		ordered.
		To do this, I embedded the &#36;{sblg-prev-base}.html link into the anchor.
		If I specify the &#36;{sblg-prev-base} (note that in both cases, I HTML-escaped the dollar sign in this article so it wasn't
		interpreted as a tag itself!) it goes to the <a href="${sblg-next-base}.html">next article</a>, wrapping around to the oldest if
		it's the newest.
